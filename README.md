**README: Parkinson's Disease Predictor**

This project aims to predict Parkinson's disease based on clinical voice recordings. Using machine learning techniques and the Parkinson's Telemonitoring Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository, we developed and evaluated predictive models. Key steps include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training (e.g., SVM, Random Forest), and evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall). Results and insights are detailed in the project report.

**Key Features:**
1. **Data Collection:** Utilized the UCI ML Repository's Parkinson's Telemonitoring Dataset.
   
2. **Preprocessing:** Cleaned and normalized voice recordings, handled missing data, and extracted relevant features.
   
3. **Modeling:** Implemented SVM, Random Forest, and other classifiers for prediction.
   
4. **Evaluation:** Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves.

**Tools Used:**
- Python (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)
- Jupyter Notebooks for development and documentation
- Matplotlib and seaborn for visualization

**Outcome:**
Achieved promising results with [insert accuracy/evaluation metrics]. Models effectively predict Parkinson's disease based on voice recordings, demonstrating potential clinical application.

**Future Steps:**
Explore deep learning techniques for enhanced accuracy. Incorporate additional clinical data for a comprehensive predictive model.
